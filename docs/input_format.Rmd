```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(hdf5r)
library(DiagrammeR)

codes <- list(
  read_hdf5 = list(
    R = 'dataset <- hdf5r::H5File$new("dataset.h5")',
    python = ''
  ),
  read_sparsematrix = list(
    R = '',
    python = ''
  )
)

cat_code <- function(id, language = params$language) {
  knitr::asis_output(codes[[id]][[language]])
}
```

```{bash}
# generate example dataset if not present
if [ ! -f data/dataset.h5 ]; then
    docker run dynverse/dyntoy --output_dataset data/dataset.h5 --model tree
fi
```

The input data will be in an hdf5 format. This can be loaded within `r params$language` using

```{r}
cat_code("read_hdf5")
```

## Biological background

Cells are constantly changing based on external and internal stimuli. These can include:

- Cell differentiation, a process where cells go from a more stem-cell like state to a specialized state
- Cell division, a process where cells replicate their DNA and split into two new cells
- Cell activate, a process where cells are activated by their environment and react to it

There are several techniques to measure the current state of a cell. In this competition we focus on the mRNA state of a cell.

## Problem description

## Input format

## Output format

## Further reading

You get as input two matrices: the counts and expression. These matrices contain the expression of genes (columns) within hundreds to millions of cells (rows).

Because the data is very sparse, the matrices are stored in a sparse format: [Compressed sparse column format (CSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_column_(CSC_or_CCS)).

They can be accessed within `r params$language` using

```{r}
cat_code("read_sparsematrix")
```
